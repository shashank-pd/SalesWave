# Sales-Management-System

Developed a user-friendly Sales Management System using C++ and OODP concepts for efficient data organization and manipulation. Enhanced functionality with features like order calculations, reports, and product search. The Sales Management System project encompassed the implementation of key object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, encapsulation, and inheritance.

Furthermore, I incorporated features such as View All Products, Search Item, Sort by Category, Sort by Price, Add Products, Sell Products, Modify Products, Generate Bill, and View Sales.
